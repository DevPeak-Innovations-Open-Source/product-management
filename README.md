# **📅 DAY 1 — The Marketplace Funnel (Your New Bible)**

If you master just this flow, you will already be better than 50% of junior PMs.

Every marketplace transaction follows **7 steps**:

### **1️⃣ Visit**

User enters your app or website.

### **2️⃣ Search / Browse**

User looks for something.

### **3️⃣ Product Detail Page (PDP)**

User checks product details.

### **4️⃣ Add to Cart**

User decides the product is worth buying.

### **5️⃣ Checkout Start**

User begins the process.

### **6️⃣ Payment**

User completes the transaction.

### **7️⃣ Post-order**

Delivery → Returns → Rating.

# **🔥 Your Job as PM**

Your job is brutal and simple:

### **Fix the leaks in this funnel.**

Every step has drop-offs:

* Search irrelevant → user leaves
* Bad PDP → low add-to-cart
* High delivery time → no buy
* High payment failures → lost GMV
* Bad packaging → return
* Poor product quality → rating drop → future GMV drop

You become dangerous when you know:

### “SHIT → WHERE exactly did the user drop?”

That’s your power.
